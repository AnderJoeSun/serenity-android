Despite the hostility of the townsfolk, the sheriff, and the judge (who is disdainful of Brisco&apos;s Harvard roots, having graduated from Yale himself), Brisco figures out that the citizen wasn&apos;t so well-liked, and in fact had left a number of little revenge ploys after his death (such as a case of anthrax for the local cattlemen). Using the new science of fingerprints, Brisco manages to solve the case: the murder victim killed himself and set up the doctor (who had been seeing his wife on the side) to make it look like the murderer. The doctor&apos;s jilted girlfriend was in cahoots, and the wife slugs her when she tries to pull a gun on the preceedings."

A female bounty hunter, Crystal Hawks, is the most persistent who captures Brisco several times (after he escapes several times). It turns out that Big Smith, Bly&apos;s former henchman, survived the fall in the pilot episode and was purified by the power of the Orb. Now he is redeeming himself by breaking into banks and returning money, and killing the bank manager he previously consorted with. Bly is also on Big Smith&apos;s trail, hopping to recover that particular Orb. In the end, Brisco clears his name, captures Smith and Bly, and turns them over to the government. However, Bly manages to escape by using the now-virtuous Smith as a shield, getting him killed in the process."
